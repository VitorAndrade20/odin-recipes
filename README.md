# odin-recipes
Recipes site project for the Odin Project Fundamentals course.

In this project, some basic HTML concepts were used. This site consists basically two types of pages:
	1 - A home page with a header and links to the pages containing the recipes.
	2 - The recipe's page, with headers, and image depicting the given recipe and both ordered (recipe's steps) and unordered (ingredients) lists.
